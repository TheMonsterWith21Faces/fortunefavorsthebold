# Fortune Favors The Bold
A simulated card game where players can choose to push their luck and increase their win multiplier.

The Cards

0 - Does nothing but stress you out
1 - adds 1 to multiplier
2 - adds 2 to multiplier
3 - adds 3 to multiplier
5 - adds 5 to multiplier
Kobold - steals your multiplier (but you can keep playing)
Dragon - Kills you (you lose and can no longer play)

You can stop drawing cards at any time and cash out or you can press your luck until you get a whamm-- er, dragon.

Legal notice

I accept no legal responsibility if you decide to use this in stupid, illegal ways it was never intended for.

Yes, I used AI in the creation of this and your opinions on that fact do not matter to me even a little. <3
